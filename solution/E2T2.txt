Some inspector findings:
Many ingress problems - we should restrict access to the instance
The instance support password authentication - makes brute-force attack possible
There are no password complexity rules
We can log in the instance as a root user

Some security hub findings:
MFA missing on account level
IAM policies problems
Ingress problems
VPC configuration problems
Log problems (CloudTrail/VPC flow)

Some config findings:
IAM policies problems
Lack of encryption
Lack of https - I see in the configuration we only open port 80, we should configure https also
Log problems
