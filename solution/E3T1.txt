The GuardDuty provided me information where, when and how an attack is happening. At first the severity was low, but it was escalated to high soon after.

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.
We can see this information on https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/
The service uses machine learning, anomaly detection, and integrated threat intelligence to identify and prioritize potential threats. GuardDuty analyzes tens of billions of events across multiple AWS data sources, such as AWS CloudTrail, Amazon VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs.
