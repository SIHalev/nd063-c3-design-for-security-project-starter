# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.
- Change the default ssh port. I would not recommend this approach
- Remove the support of password authentication. In the Inspector it even says that its presence could lead to brute force attack
- Hardened Bastion host


# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.
- Encryption on rest should be enabled
- Revoke API credentials
