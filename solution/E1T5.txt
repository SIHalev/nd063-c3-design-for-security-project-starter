Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
The first major problem that I see is that the s3 buckets access:
- They are not following the principle of the least privileged
- The users does not go through an IAM role and policy
- They appear to be directly publicly accessible

Few bad situations:
- Everyone from the internet can access them, so if a security security leak occurs everyone can get them without restrictions
- What will happens if we want to revoke an access of single privileged business user, this is hard in our current setup

# Poor practice 2
The second major problem that I see is the web service instance ingress rules, or the lack of them. This could make our system vulnerable to an attacker.
I would probably don't want to direct access to the instance, only parts of the system should have access to it.
If we need access to the web service instance, maybe we only go through a hardened bastion instance.
