# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
- Adding AWS WAF will help us with OWASP Top 10 security risks
- Improve policies and introduce keys rotation
- Centralized CloudTrail logs
- Adding hardened bastion host
- Create notification alerts
- MFA as a requirement for the privileged business user accessing our secret recipes.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
No, IAM restrictive permission should aways be in place. That's like not putting a password/scanner on your phone, because it will not leave your pocket without your knowing.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
It will remain unencrypted.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
We would lose our changes that we have made for better or worse. In our case this would definitely be for worse.
